7. Security Architecture
Security is implemented using a defense-in-depth strategy with multiple layers of protection. The system complies with Ghana Data Protection Act, ISO 27001, and OWASP Top 10 guidelines.

7.1 Security Layers
Network Security
VPC isolation with private subnets for databases and blockchain nodes
Security groups and NACLs for ingress/egress filtering
DDoS protection via CloudFlare / AWS Shield
WAF (Web Application Firewall) with OWASP rule sets
IDS/IPS for intrusion detection and prevention

Application Security
API Gateway with rate limiting (100 req/min per user)
OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect for authentication
JWT tokens with short expiry (15 minutes) and refresh tokens
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) with fine-grained permissions
Input validation and sanitization at API layer
CORS configuration for allowed origins
CSRF protection with tokens

Data Security
TLS 1.3 for all data in transit
AES-256 encryption for data at rest
Database encryption (PostgreSQL pgcrypto, MongoDB encryption)
Field-level encryption for sensitive PII
Blockchain data immutability for audit trail
Secure key storage in HSM (FIPS 140-2 Level 3)
Regular database backups with encryption

Identity & Access Management
Biometric authentication (fingerprint, face recognition)
Multi-factor authentication (MFA) for admin users
Device binding for surveyors
Session management with timeout (30 minutes idle)
Password policy (12+ chars, complexity, rotation)
Privileged access management (PAM) for system admins
Audit logging of all authentication events

Compliance & Privacy
PII data redaction in public APIs
Data minimization principles
Consent management for data processing
Right to access, rectification, and erasure (GDPR-style)
Data retention policies
Privacy impact assessments
Regular compliance audits


7.2 Authentication Flow
1. User enters credentials (username/password) or presents biometric
2. Frontend sends authentication request to API Gateway
3. API Gateway routes to Identity Service (Keycloak)
4. Identity Service validates credentials against PostgreSQL
5. If biometric, Biometric SDK matches template
6. On success, Keycloak generates JWT access token (15 min) and refresh token (7 days)
7. Tokens returned to frontend and stored in secure storage (HttpOnly cookies for web, SecureStore for mobile)
8. Subsequent API calls include JWT in Authorization header
9. API Gateway validates JWT signature and expiry
10. If expired, frontend uses refresh token to obtain new access token
11. All authentication events logged to audit_logs table

7.3 Data Encryption Strategy
Data Type
Encryption Method
Key Management
Data in Transit
TLS 1.3 with ECDHE cipher suites
Certificate management via Let's Encrypt / DigiCert
Database (at rest)
AES-256 encryption, transparent data encryption (TDE)
Master keys in HSM, automatic key rotation
Object Storage
Server-side encryption (SSE-S3/SSE-KMS)

10.1 Offline Architecture
Local Data Storage: SQLite database on mobile device for user data, survey drafts, cached land records (Encrypted with device keychain)
Offline Survey Capture: Full survey form completion with GPS coordinates, photos, attachments (Stores up to 100 surveys locally)
Offline Authentication: Biometric authentication works offline using stored template (Falls back to PIN code)
Offline Payments: Smartcard-based payments with stored value, later reconciliation (Lands Commission smartcard)
Offline Map Access: Pre-cached map tiles for surveyor's region (up to 500MB) (Update monthly)
Background Sync: Automatic synchronization when connectivity detected (Retry with exponential backoff)
Conflict Resolution: Server-wins strategy for conflicts, manual resolution for critical data (Conflict notification to user)

10.2 Synchronization Flow
1. Mobile app detects internet connectivity (WiFi or cellular)
2. Checks for pending local changes (surveys, photos, payments)
3. Sends authentication request with refresh token
4. On success, initiates sync session with server
5. Uploads pending surveys with digital signatures
6. Server validates data, checks for conflicts
7. If conflict detected, applies conflict resolution strategy
8. Server processes uploads, stores in database, triggers blockchain events
9. Server responds with sync confirmation and server-side changes
10. Mobile app downloads server changes (new title approvals, notifications)
11. Updates local database with server data
12. Marks synced items as complete, removes from pending queue
13. Displays sync summary notification to user

11. User Interface Design
11.1 Wireframes
11.1.1 Citizen Portal Dashboard
